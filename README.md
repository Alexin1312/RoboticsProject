# RoboticsProject
robotic project of printing a defined coordinates(in this case a name path withBrush Script MT font) on an A4 surface using SCARA based robot

This project is a simple demonstration of how to manipulate the end affector of 6-DOF robot using roboDK development tools. Main objective of the project is to:

• Asses the ability of developing forward and reverse kinematic equations of particular robot
• Create complex path planning and optimization algorithm for specified robot
• Ability to integrate high DOF robot to execute precise and useful movement
